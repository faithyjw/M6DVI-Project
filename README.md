Hello there! I am Faith:) 😊

This repository contains the files that were used and the programming aspect of my project, "Before and During the Pandemic Transportation Patterns Analytics in Singapore". 

I have analysed the 3 transportation categories, which are "Air", "Land", and "Sea".

Link to the report will be uploaded soon!

The file "FaithYeo_32_PT2101Q_M6Project" shows the output of the codes/ how the data visualisations looks like!

Feel free to use, should you feel that the files and codes are essential to your project too! 

Heads up! 
1. Coding was done in the Python Language (and a little of Data Analysis Expression (DAX)). 
2. For the codes to work, libraries that are needed to be installed are "pandas" and "NumPy".
3. Versions used: [Python: 2.8.2], [pandas: 1.5.1], [NumPy: 1.23.4]
4. I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

Thank you :)
