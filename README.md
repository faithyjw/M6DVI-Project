Hello there! I am Faith:) ðŸ˜Š

I have analysed the 3 transportation categories, which are "Air", "Land", and "Sea".

The file "FaithYeo_32_PT2101Q_M6Project" shows the output of the codes/ how the data visualisations looks like!

Feel free to use, should you feel that the files and codes are essential to your project too! 

Heads up! 
1. Coding was done in the Python Language (and a little of Data Analysis Expression (DAX)). 
2. For the codes to work, libraries that are needed to be installed are "pandas" and "NumPy".
3. Versions used: [Python: 2.8.2], [pandas: 1.5.1], [NumPy: 1.23.4]
4. I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

Thank you :)
